#### 👋 Hi, I’m @siruzhong

Greetings! 👀 I am currently pursuing my **MPhil** degree at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/). Currently, I have the privilege of being mentored by [Yuxuan Liang](https://yuxuanliang.com/), who leading the [CityMind lab](https://citymind.top), and my research delves into the intriguing fields of Spatio-Temporal Data Science, Multimodal Analysis, and Urban Computing. Before that, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from [Hefei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/), majoring in IoT Engineering within the [School of Computer and Information](https://ci.hfut.edu.cn/).

Prior to my academic journey, I worked as a **Backend Development Engineer** at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/), where I was involved in cloud research and development, event bus systems, DevOps, and improving engineering efficiency. 🌱
