#### 👋 Hi, I’m @siruzhong

Greetings! 👀 I am currently pursuing an **MPhil** degree at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in Guangzhou. I am fortunate to be under the guidance of [Yuxuan Liang](http://yuxuanliang.com/), where my research focuses on Spatio-Temporal Data Science, Multimodal Analysis, and Urban Computing. I am a member of the CityMind lab, a dedicated team committed to shaping the future of AI and Data Mining for Spatio-Temporal Data. You can explore our work at [citymind.top](https://citymind.top)!

Prior to my academic journey, I worked as a **Background R&D Engineer** at **Tencent**, where I was involved in cloud research and development, event bus systems, DevOps, and improving engineering efficiency. 🌱
