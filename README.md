# About Me

I am a first-year **MPhil** student in [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](http://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Yuxuan Liang](https://yuxuanliang.com/) in [CityMind lab](https://citymind.top).

Prior to this, I worked as a **Backend Development Engineer** at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/), focusing on container scheduling, event orchestration and infrastructure development. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from [Hefei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/) in 2022, major in IoT Engineering within the [School of Computer and Information](https://ci.hfut.edu.cn/).
