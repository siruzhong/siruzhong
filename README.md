Hi guys 👀, I am currently an MPhil student at HKUST(GZ), supervised by [Yuxuan Liang](http://yuxuanliang.com/), where I explore Spatio-Temporal Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Intelligent Transportation, and Smart Cities. Our lab is called CityMind, we are dedicated to shaping the future of AI/DM for Spatio-Temporal Data, and you can access it at [citymind.top](https://citymind.top)!
