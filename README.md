#### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @siruzhong

I am a first-year **MPhil** student in [DSA Thrust](http://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/), where I'm supervised by Prof. [Yuxuan Liang](https://yuxuanliang.com/) in [CityMind lab](https://citymind.top). My research interests revolve around Spatio-Temporal Data Science, Multimodal Learning, and Urban Computing. 

Before diving into academia, I served as a **Backend Development Engineer** at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/), where my responsibilities spanned cloud research and development, event bus systems, DevOps, and enhancing engineering efficiency. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from [Hefei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/) in 2022, specializing in IoT Engineering within the [School of Computer and Information](https://ci.hfut.edu.cn/).
