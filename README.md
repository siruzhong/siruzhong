#### 👋 Hi, I’m @siruzhong

Greetings! 👀 I am currently pursuing my **MPhil** degree at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Guangzhou](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/), where I have the privilege of being mentored by Prof. [Yuxuan Liang](https://yuxuanliang.com/), who leads the innovative [CityMind lab](https://citymind.top). My research interests focus on the intriguing fields of Spatio-Temporal Data Science, Multimodal Analysis, and Urban Computing. 

Before diving into academia, I served as a **Backend Development Engineer** at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/), where my responsibilities spanned cloud research and development, event bus systems, DevOps, and enhancing engineering efficiency. Prior to this, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Engineering from [Hefei University of Technology](https://www.hfut.edu.cn/) in 2022, specializing in IoT Engineering within the [School of Computer and Information](https://ci.hfut.edu.cn/).
